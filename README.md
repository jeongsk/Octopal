## What is Octopal?

Octopal is an Electron-based group-chat messenger for AI agents. Each agent is a `.octo` JSON file that lives in your project folder — think of it as a virtual coworker with its own role, memory, and conversation history.

- **Group chat interface** — Talk to multiple agents at once, or `@mention` a specific one
- **Persistent agents** — Close the app, come back days later; memory and history are still there
- **Folder-based workspaces** — Each folder is a project; `.octo` files inside are your team
- **Powered by Claude** — Agents run on Anthropic's Claude via the Claude CLI

## Features

- Multi-agent group chat with `@mention` routing
- Dark theme UI with real-time streaming responses
- Agent creation, editing, and role management
- Automatic agent chaining (hidden dispatcher)
- Unicode mention support (Korean, Japanese, etc.)
- Workspace switching with folder management
- Background processing without throttling
